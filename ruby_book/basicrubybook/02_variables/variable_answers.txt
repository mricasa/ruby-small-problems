Look at the following programs...

x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?

For the first program, 3 will be printed to the screen

In the second, putting x will print not print anything because x is only within the inner scope of the block, not the
outer scope
